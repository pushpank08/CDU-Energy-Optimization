# Crude Oil Distillation Unit (CDU) Energy Optimization

## Overview
This project simulates the energy consumption of a Crude Oil Distillation Unit (CDU) and implements energy optimization using Python. The project calculates energy requirements for different crude fractions, applies heat recovery, and optimizes efficiency to minimize total energy consumption.

## Features
- Calculates energy required for **Light, Medium, and Heavy** crude fractions.
- Implements **heat recovery optimization** using `scipy.optimize`.
- Visualizes energy savings before and after optimization using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
- Calculates percentage energy savings per fraction.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Google Colab
- Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- SciPy (for optimization)

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in **[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)**.
2. Run all cells sequentially.
3. The notebook calculates energy, finds optimal heat recovery efficiency, and displays visualizations.
